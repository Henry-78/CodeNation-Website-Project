        <img src="homebar1.jpg"><p> Heed every word, child. You are Viltrumite! Though born on Thraxa, you are of my blood and shall have more than Our World as you see it here. We are promised resources and servitude by planets that make up the ever-expanding universe, and all we must do to have it is to take it. You see, child, we need YOU to fight alongside your brothers and sisters, to brave yourself for our fight to come. We are an unyielding force. Train relentlessly, learn the weaknesses of Our Enemies and show no restraint. We fight for us all. We fight for my Empire.</p>

Because of this, I, myself alone, have turned our people into a productive, thriving Empire. Your humble start.</p>

            There are traitorous Viltrumites, ruled by a traitorous king gone mad. He is aided by his two sons, known weaklings of our genetic disposition. Be advised, many of them are almost as strong as me, few and far between.</p>

            	Overview<br>
            •	The Coalition of Planets are on the backward hovel of the planet, Talescria. Our forces have since ravaged their headquarters, but like vermin, they persist against us.<br>
            <img src="cop.jpg"><br> 
            	Their Ranks<br>
            •	The current order of the Coalition of Planets places Allen, a petulant Unopan, as their leader. He is apparently mighty, but susceptible to distraction.
